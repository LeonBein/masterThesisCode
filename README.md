# masterThesisCode

This is the Jupyter notebook used for the evaluation interviews in the author's master's thesis.

You can set it up manually, or automatically by running the setup.sh file on Linux or WSL. A current version of Python3 is expected to be pre-installed (developed on Python 3.6.9).

Setup should automatically start JupyterLab. Otherwise you can manually start it with:
```
source .venv/bin/activate; jupyter lab
```
